# Self-Driving Car Using NEAT and Pygame
This project is a self-driving car simulation where you can draw a path for the car to follow, and the car uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to learn and drive along the path autonomously. The system leverages the power of artificial neural networks to train the car in real-time based on the user's drawn path.
