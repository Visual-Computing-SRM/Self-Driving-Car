# Self-Driving Car Using NEAT and Pygame
This project is a self-driving car simulation where you can draw a path for the car to follow, and the car uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to learn and drive along the path autonomously. The system leverages the power of artificial neural networks to train the car in real-time based on the user's drawn path.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

pygame: for rendering the canvas where you can draw the path.
neat-python: for implementing the NEAT algorithm to train the car.

The project is compatible with Python versions suited for both pygame and neat-python.

Python Version Compatibility
Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
Make sure you have pygame and neat-python installed in your environment for proper functionality.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Install Python 3.x
If you don't have Python 3.x installed, you can download it from the official Python website.

Install Dependencies
Install pygame and neat-python by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pygame

pip install neat-python

Run the Project
You can start the simulation by running:

python main.py

The Pygame window will open, and you can start drawing the path for the car to follow.
